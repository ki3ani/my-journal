If you are dating online, he probably just wants to know what you look like. But beware of the predators out there who use pictures in ways you would not approve of. If you know each other in person, think about how well you know him. If you know him well or you are friends, he might find you attractive or have feelings for you. Think about your own feelings and respond accordingly. After all, it's up to you whether you want to send your picture or not and that depends on how you feel about that guy.",
